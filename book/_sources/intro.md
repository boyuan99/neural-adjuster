# Welcome to Neural Adjuster

This is a simple slider tool that allows you to understand how each parameter affects the neural response and to find the best parameter you want.

It shows off a few of the major neuron models, as well as some synapse models. Check out [the Github repository](https://github.com/boyuan99/neural-adjuster) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this jupyter book to see more.
